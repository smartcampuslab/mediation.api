# Our List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words #

With millions of images in our library and billions of user-submitted keywords, we work hard at Shutterstock to make sure that bad words don't show up in places they shouldn't.  This repo contains a list of words that we use to filter results from our autocomplete server and recommendation engine.

Please add to it as you see fit (particularly in non-English languages) or use it to spice up your next game of Scrabble :)

Obvious warning: These lists contain material that many will find offensive.  (But that's the point!)

Miscellaneous caveat: Clearly, what goes in these lists is subjective.  In our case, the question we use is, "What wouldn't we want to *suggest* that people look at?"  This of course varies between culture, language, and geographies, so in the end we just have to make our best guess.
